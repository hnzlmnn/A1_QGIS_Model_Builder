# 2.2 Creating a raster mosaic
## What is the difference between the two output files?
The file size and it's content. The merged image contains all pixels from both images, whereas the vrt only contains a XML structure that describes the merging process.
## What might be an advantage of using `gdalbuildvrt` instead of `gdalmerge`?
The vrt is only usable with the source files available. The merged tiff can be used on it's own. THe advantage would be that vrt files can represent multiple mosaics with less space being used.
